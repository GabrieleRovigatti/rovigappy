## how three brothers will rule the game

What happens when a professor in physics, a central banker, and a machine learning consultant meet? Usually, nothing. This time, instead, we decided to start playing with deep learning techniques - just for fun. More specifically, we do what everybody else in the world has done at least once: train a deep learning algorithm in order to screw the sport betting market!

### The Language

We plan to use Pyhton for the whole project, from scraping the relevant data to setting up and training the model. From time to time, as we progress, we will upload the code and the data

### The Data
